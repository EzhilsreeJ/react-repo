      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced. This can be
      useful for, for example, `href` or `src` attributes of HTML tags.
      For example, `href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico"` will produce the same
      result as `href="/favicon.ico"` or `href="favicon.ico"` if `public` is at the root of the domain.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.
      Because of JavaScript, the page will be dynamically populated with content.
      To minimize bundle size and improve performance, your webpack configuration
      (built on CRA's default configuration) optimizes this file
      for production.
      By default, the `npm run build` or `yarn build` command will bundle
      your source code into a set of small JavaScript files that are
      automatically injected into this HTML file.
      This is so you can perform `npm install` or `yarn install` first.
      In development mode, it's not necessary to run a build tool.
      The setup of the create-react-app project assumes that you have Node.js
      and npm or yarn installed.
      See https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started
      for more information about starting a project.
